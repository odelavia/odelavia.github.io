            There's not much I don't enjoy doing.
            One of my biggest interests is solving problems.<br/>
            It doesn't matter in what form they come, I've love solving problems.

            I taught myself to draw when I was 5 so I could make cool tv characters one day.<br/>
            I paint realistic portraiture now.<br/>
            I taught myself how to powerlift when I was 14 because no one bullies the strong guy.<br/>
            I did it for a decade and became a contender for the national record in my weight class.<br/>
            I taught myself to ride, build, and fix a bike so that I could travel across Europe and africa on less than $5/day for nearly a year.<br/>
            I saw 50+ cities and only went over budget when someone stole my bike. Friends donated a new bike but that's another story.

            Oct, 30th, 2017 I got back from 3 months of driving and camping around 18 U.S. national parks.
            I came back to a slow construction season and was without work. I taught myself to code because I needed a job in an industry that wasn't seasonal.<br/>
            I kept at it because I was impressed at the freedom one has when they can build software from scratch.
